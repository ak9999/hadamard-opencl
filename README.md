# Vector Multiplication

This program creates two arrays of equal sizes and performs a bitwise OR operation on both to assign values to a new array 'result'.

The contents of all 3 arrays are printed to the terminal.

# Building

The accompanying Makefile targets 64-bit Linux distributions with the CUDA Toolkit installed.

# To do:

Actually implement the vector multiplication.
