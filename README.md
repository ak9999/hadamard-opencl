# Vector Multiplication

This program creates two arrays of equal sizes and performs a bitwise OR operation on both to assign values to a new array 'result'.

The contents of all 3 arrays are printed to the terminal.

# Building

Run `make`

Works on Mac and Linux.
Those on Windows should read this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23173374/configure-opencl-under-cygwin) to set up MinGW with OpenCL libraries.

# To do:

Actually implement the vector multiplication.
